* ppa:ondrej/php issue tracker
This GitHub project is the issue tracker of [PPA for PHP (5.6, 7.0)](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php).

Please submit bug reports and feature request about the PPA as [issues here](https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/issues).   Please report any bugs or feature requests there, since my INBOX is a not very reliable way how to keep track on all issues since it has the tendency to grow number of unread messages to numbers over thousand...

DEB.SURY.ORG now has official Twitter account [@debsuryorg](https://twitter.com/debsuryorg).  Please monitor it for updates about packaging.

The PHP packaging is time consuming and I do this mostly in my free time. Please consider donating if you find the PHP packages useful for your projects or your business. It also warms a heart to know that this project is useful.
