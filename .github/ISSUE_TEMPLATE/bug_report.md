**Frequently asked questions**

- [ ] I have read [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/oerdnj/deb.sury.org/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)
- [ ] I have looked at the list of the existing issues (including closed issues) and searched if my issue has been already reported
- [ ] I have tried to resolve the issue myself and will describe what I did in clear and concise manner

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

Please understand that this issue tracker is specifically meant to report issues with the packages and with the repositories. I won't teach you the basics of system administration, I won't help you with bugs in the software itself. For both, there are better sites where are people with more free time that allows them to be more friendly to newcomers.

Please make sure you read [Dear anonymous internet user asking for help...](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/anonymous-help/) by Bert Hubert and [How to Report Bugs Effectively](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) by Simon Tatham.

If you understand the purpose of this issue tracker and describe your **problem** accurately (where the template below will help), I might be able to help you.
