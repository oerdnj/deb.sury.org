**Unsupported distributions**
 - [ ] I'm *not* using [Ubuntu Trusty (14.04)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/private-ubuntu-30596045)

**Extensions for unreleased PHP version**
- [ ] I'm *not* requesting PECL extensions for pre-release version of PHP (PHP 7.4.0 is OK, PHP 7.4.0RC is not)

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Please understand that this issue tracker is specifically meant to report issues with the packages and with the repositories. I won't teach you the basics of system administration, I won't help you with bugs in the software itself. For both, there are better sites where are people with more free time that allows them to be more friendly to newcomers.
